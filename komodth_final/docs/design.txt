Problem Statement: A program will be written which takes in two adjectives, 
  four verbs, three nouns, a relative’s name, a type of bird, a liquid, a room 
  in the house, and a body part.  A relative’s name, a room in the house, and a 
  liquid will be prompts while the rest will be drop down menus with 15 options 
  each.  After all words are chosen or entered, a button will be pushed that 
  indicates the user is done and they will be taken to a different screen where 
  they will see the mad lib, filled in with the words they have chosen.

Nouns: adjectives
	nouns
	verbs
	a relative’s name
	a type of bird
	a liquid
	a room in the house
	a body part

Verbs:   prompt
	drop down
	(button)pushed
	

Defining Diagram:
Inputs

	roomInHouse
	typeOfBird
	liquid
	relativeName
	bodyPart
	verb
	verbPastTense
	verbIng	
	verbIng2	

Processing:
	Prompt for roomInHouse, liquid, and relative name
	Accept drop down choices for all other variables listed above
 	//Make sure that user hasn't chosen the same noun, adjective, or verb
          //ending in ing by eliminating that choice in the drop down menu
	*This proved more complicated than originally thought so it was
           dropped from the code.
 	User pushes button to generate MadLib
	Display MadLib with user inputs embedded

Output:

	MadLib with user inputs embedded

***Once again I needed to replace a word.  Tooths wouldn't have made any sense if it got
  chosen for a plural spot.  I replaced it with bone.***
